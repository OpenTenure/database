	<comments>The SOLA implementation of the LADM Spatial Unit Package. Represents parcels of land and water that can be associated to rights (a.k.a. Cadastre Objects) as well as general spatial or geographic features such as roads, hydro and place names, etc. General spatial features are also known as Spatial Units in SOLA.</comments>

		<table name="Function: add_topo_points" comments="Alters the topology of the target geometry by merging selected coordinates from the source geometry into the target geometry. Only those coordinates from the source geometry that are within the map-tolerance distance of the target geometry boundary are merged. Used during spatial editing of parcels to ensure parcels adjacent of the edit remain topologically consistent with any new parcels. "/>
		<table name="Function: cadastre_object_name_is_valid" comments="Verifies that the name assigned to a new cadastre object is consistent with the cadastre object naming rules."/>
		<table name="Function: generate_spatial_unit_group_name" comments="Determines the hierarchical name to assign a new Spatial Unit Group."/>
		<table name="Function: get_map_center_label" comments="Returns a value that is displayed in the centre of the Public Display Maps for Systematic Registration. This function has default code that should be updated for each implementation of SOLA."/>
		<table name="Function: get_new_cadastre_object_identifier_first_part" comments="Used to determine the value for the first name part for a new cadastre object. This function has default code that should be updated for each implementation of SOLA to match the cadastre object naming conventions used by the implementing organisation."/>
		<table name="Function: get_new_cadastre_object_identifier_last_part" comments="Used to determine the value for the last name part for a new cadastre object. This function has default code that should be updated for each implementation of SOLA to match the cadastre object naming conventions used by the implementing organisation."/>
		<table name="Function: snap_geometry_to_geometry" comments="Snaps one geometry to the other adding points if required. Not used by SOLA."/>
		<table name="Trigger Function: f_for_tbl_cadastre_object_trg_geommodify" comments="Function triggered on insert or update to the cadastre_object table.  Uses the add_topo_points function to merge the topology of any parcels adjacent to parcel being updated. Only applied if the parcel being updated has a current status."/>
		<table name="Trigger Function: f_for_tbl_cadastre_object_trg_new" comments="Function triggered on insert to the cadastre_object table.  Inserts a record in the spatial_unit table for the cadastre_object if no spatial_unit record for the new cadastre_object exists."/>
		<table name="Trigger Function: f_for_tbl_cadastre_object_trg_remove" comments="Function triggered on delete from the cadastre_object table. Cascade deletes the record in the spatial_unit table for the cadastre_object."/>
