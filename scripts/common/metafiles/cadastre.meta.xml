	<comments>The SOLA implementation of the LADM Spatial Unit Package. Represents parcels of land and water that can be associated to rights (a.k.a. Cadastre Objects) as well as general spatial or geographic features such as roads, hydro and place names, etc. General spatial features are also known as Spatial Units in SOLA.</comments>

		<table name="Function: add_topo_points" comments="Alters the topology of the target geometry by merging selected coordinates from the source geometry into the target geometry. Only those coordinates from the source geometry that are within the map-tolerance distance of the target geometry boundary are merged. Used during spatial editing of parcels to ensure parcels adjacent of the edit remain topologically consistent with any new parcels. "/>
