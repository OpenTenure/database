		<table name="Function: get_geometry_with_srid" comments="Determines the SRID for a geometry by comparing the longitude value of its centriod to values in the system.crs table. If the geometry is in a different SRID, it is transformed into the appropriate SRID and returned, otherwise it is retuned unchanged."/>

		<table name="Trigger Function: f_for_trg_track_changes" comments="Function triggered on insert or update of any SOLA table that is subject to history recording. The function ensures the change user details are recorded along with the date and time of the change. It also checks the rowversion to ensure the record has not been inadvertently updated by 2 or more people at the same time (i.e. implements optimistic locking) and increments the rowversion as required."/>
		<table name="Trigger Function: f_for_trg_track_history" comments="Function triggered on insert or update of any SOLA table that is subject to history recording. The function copies the original content of a record (i.e. before it is modified) to the appropriate _historic table. This ensures a full history of all changes to a record are maintained for audit purposes."/>
