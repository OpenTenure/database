# Linux/MacOS Bash script that uses the PostgreSQL pg_dump utility
# to extract the SOLA schema into plain text SQL files. The 
# create_database script can then be used to re-create or upgrade
# the SOLA database on other computers as required.    

# IMPORTANT - pg_dump was changed in PostgreSQL 9.3 to require
# the database parameter to be explicitly identified with 
# the -d option. Use this script when extracting from 
# PostgreSQL 9.2 and below. 
 
# Configure variables to use for script:

# The current directory where this command has been executed from
current_dir=$(pwd)  
# Default install location for pg_dump on linux/Debian. This location
# may need to be modified if a different version of postgresql
# is being used and/or it is installed in a custom location.
