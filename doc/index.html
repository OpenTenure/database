  <p><b>Version: Release 1509a</b></p>
  <p>Generated by SchemaSpy</p>
  <p>The SOLA Community Server database has been created as part of a project undertaken by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization with funding from the Government of Finland to develop open source software that supports cadastre and
registration functions in land administration agencies. It has a particular goal of making computerized systems
supporting open land administration more affordable and sustainable in developing countries.</p>
<p>The Community Server database has been developed using the PostgreSQL open source database and is an implementation of an
extended version of the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM). LADM is published as ISO 19152 by the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO). It has been necessary to extend ISO 19152 because of the operational needs 
of land administration agencies
to incorporate case management and other features into any system that supports the processing of client service
requests (for land information, registration and cadastre change requests and others) and the maintaining and
updating of the record of rights and restrictions, ownership and property boundaries.</p>
<p>The Community Server Data Dictionary is organized according to the schemas defined in the Community Server database. To navigate the dictionary, follow the hyperlinks available on each page. Each schema section includes a list of all tables within the schema along with table descriptions, column list, constraints and relationship details. Database views and functions are also described. <b>Click the schema hyperlinks below for detailed information.</b></p>
